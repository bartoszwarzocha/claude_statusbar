## [0.2.2] - 2025-10-27

### Added
- **Session reset notifications**: Configurable notifications when session timer reaches zero
  - Notification #1: "Claude session ended" appears immediately when timer hits 0:00:00
  - Notification #2: "No new session detected" appears after 30 seconds if no activity detected
  - Both notifications configurable via VS Code settings
  - Settings:
    - `claudeStatusBar.notifications.sessionEnded` (default: true)
    - `claudeStatusBar.notifications.noNewSessionWarning` (default: true)
- **Refreshing state**: Status bar and popup now show "Refreshing..." state during session reset checks
- **30-second timeout logic**: Smart detection waits up to 30 seconds before showing "no session" warning
  - Allows time for Claude Code to write new messages to disk
  - Immediately shows stats if new session detected within timeout period
- **Development roadmap**: Added ROADMAP.md with detailed feature planning through v1.0.0

### Changed
- **Improved no-session message clarity**:
  - Changed from: "No Claude Code session found for today"
  - Changed to: "No active Claude Code session detected"
  - Removed misleading "for today" language (sessions reset every 5 hours, not daily)
  - Added actionable guidance: "Start a conversation with Claude to activate a new tracking session"

### Fixed
- Session reset detection now properly tracks state across multiple refresh cycles
- Background refresh continues checking for new sessions every 5 seconds during "Refreshing" state

## Release Notes

### [0.2.2] - Session Reset Notifications
This release adds intelligent session reset notifications with a 30-second detection window. When your session timer reaches zero, the extension will notify you and check for new activity for up to 30 seconds before alerting you that no new session was detected. This prevents false positives when you're actively starting a new conversation.

### [0.2.1] - Daily Message Filtering
Improved accuracy by filtering to today's messages only, reducing processing overhead and focusing on current day usage.

### [0.2.0] - Enhanced UI & Calculations
Major visual overhaul with detailed analytics, improved session calculations, and comprehensive token/cost/project breakdowns.

### [0.1.0] - Initial Release
First public release with core monitoring features, real-time updates, and multi-plan support.
